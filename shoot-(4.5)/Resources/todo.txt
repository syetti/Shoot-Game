--IDEA - Overload. Each player has bar of mental. Repeated actions from other players that illicit a response fill 
	the bar until they're stunned for a certain period. Mimic mental fatigue.
		-Fatigue bar depletes as you make the opponent react 

--Win - shoot or throw opp

--Lose - get thrown or shot on

--Options:
	Shoot:
		- attack towards opp by covering 0.15 meters (lol) over .083 seconds. (~200 pixels over 5 frames)
		- if shooting at already shooting opponent both players take mental fatigue and reset positions
	Block - block shot attacks. 
	Throw - throw blocking opp.

	(?)Faint - fake the shot, make the opp commit to something (fill up fatigue bar)
	
	
	-Blocking easier than shooting, insentivze use of fatigue

--Frame Data:
	-Will be updated later...

- redo sprite legs. ugly.
